# docker_microservices_template
A repository to help someone get started with a Docker Compose orchestrated code base. This repository demonstrates a generic web stack using:

- **PostgreSQL** for stateful data storage.
- **Node.js** for backend API logic.
- **React** for the front-end user interface.

The stack is containerized and orchestrated using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and manage all components together.
